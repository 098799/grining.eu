A book I've read back in the summer of 2012, when I was devouring Murakami's books one by one. A very personal, down-to-earth book, in a strong contrast to other prose by Murakami, unlike any other running books on my shelf either. It's a simple memoir of a training period, interwoven with a number of memorable stories: running a full 42 kilometres and 195 metres between Athens and the village of Marathon, successfully completing a triathlon and even enduring the horrifying 100 kilometres long ultramarathon.

Haruki's lifelong adventure with running starts, as it often does, as a way to trim a few extra pounds. It develops into much more though: time set aside to clear his mind, a special ritual, a way to test his physical limits. Murakami writes about his favourite sport the way he'd probably write about falling in love: an infatuation that regardless of all the obstacles develops into a stable and long lasting commitment. By allowing the reader to peek into his private life, the author lets us understand why so many of the male protagonists in his other works are the way they are: detached, calm, even apathetic; he himself shares many of those traits.

I cannot stress enough how big of an impact this book had on me. It might be the main reason why I started taking running seriously even in the blazing hot and awfully humid summer of North Carolina. I don't think I can pinpoint what exactly have I found so alluring in Murakami's memoir, but if I had to guess, I'd say it was the oneiric and stoic atmosphere of his struggle with nature. But on the other hand, is it truly possible to explain why is all of his prose so captivating?

A very short piece of about 180 pages, the book is definitely worth picking up whether you're a runner or not. A word of caution though, for the readers of non-running kind: you might become jealous of writer's affection and fall for it yourself.
