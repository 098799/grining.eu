<p>An autobiographical novel by the professor of mathematics, Edward Frenkel, came to my attention after watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oazb7IWzbA">numberphile</a> video starring the author himself. As much as I enjoyed the book, I can't shake off the feeling that the title is a bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>-y -- perhaps the title "Love of Math" would be more fitting, as that is in fact the main premise of the work.
</p>

<p>The novel jumps between autobiographical sections describing the, arguably brilliant, career of the author, and chapters devoted to the mathematics he was involved in. Starting with the picture of a mid 1980's USSR high school, it shows the struggle of a young and ambitious student facing the reality of the world he lives in, his first academic achievements and his development as a mathematician. Sections on his contributions to math are described with additional detail in extensive footnotes.
</p>

<p>The author in numerous interviews points out that the book he has written is supposed to show the beauty of mathematics to the general audience. He uses the analogy of the student who, after years of being taught how to paint a fence as a complete art education, despises art never having seen the work of great masters. I find this analogy flawed. Mathematics requires a lot of time and effort to be understood and the footnotes, in which the author tries to briefly explain the maths he's talking about, illustrate this fact perfectly. I know my fair bit of math and understood some concepts in the book right away, precisely because I have spent a lot of time and effort in the past studying mathematics. Other concepts remained to me almost as alien as before reading the explainations. I can only imagine how much of the book's content will be understood by the member of the general audience.
</p>

<p>Mathematics is not easy. Every once in a while there will be Feynmans and Frenkels who will be so intimately acquainted with math and science that they will think it can be described in a simple way to everyone. I humbly disagree.
</p>

<p>The book is a great read provided you're interested and at least a little bit skilled in mathematics. It's definitely an inspiring read and shows how much there is to know in the world of modern mathematics.
