<p>
The amount of actual text in the book contrasts very strongly with the length of the full title.
The book, while not that short (6000 kindle locations, about 320 pages), is comprised in a big part of tables &mdash; listing very specific information allowing one to create a custom training plan &mdash; and sidenotes, or more accurately, sale pitches &mdash; explained below. Beside chapters dedicated to the FIRST (Furman Institute of Running and Scientific Training) training program one can also find sections on the purpose of training, performance factors and supplemental training.
</p>

<p>
The meat of the book constitutes the aforementioned FIRST training program. It can be summarised by saying: don't waste your time on <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Toxic_Miles">toxic miles</a>. Authors note that the only physical exercises that yield significant improvement in endurance and speed are the ones that stress one's body enough. Simple jogging for a moderate amount of time at the low percentage of the maximum heart rate indeed might have little impact on one's ability to run faster or to sustain a longer tempo run. Authors propose a training regimen of three quality runs per week with additional two cross-training days. Quality runs consist of
<ul>
<li>a tempo run, that is, a longer run at a certain speed near the lactate threashold,</li>
<li>an interval training, which translates into a training that includes sudden bursts of activity at a high percentage of maximum heart rate and</li>
<li>a long run, which is necessarily slower than the others and is supposed to stress one's muscle endurance.</li>
</ul>
Effectiveness of this approach is shown by invoking countless "sales pitches" &mdash; stories sent to the authors by satisfied customers.
</p>

<p>
While I generally agree with authors' point of view, I also have some misgivings about applying this formula to myself. I have struggled a couple of times with running injuries that happened solely because I tried to do <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Too_Much_Too_Soon">too much, too soon</a>. I'm afraid that jumping right into three quality runs might stress one's body enough to significantly increase the risk of an injury. I'm quite convinced that one needs to gradually build up resistance to stress by increasing weekly milage and the easiest way to do so is to perform a certain amount of easy runs. In general though, I'm all for quality runs and understanding which part of training is important and how it affects one's ability to perform.
</p>

<p>
The book is concise and enjoyable to read &mdash; provided you skip through sales pitches. They might be interesting and motivating at first, but get old quickly. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in planning a training regimen for a better performance in the long distance runs.

<h3>Footnotes:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Actually, the full title of this book is as long as <i>Runner's World Run Less, Run Faster: Become a Faster, Stronger Runner with the Revolutionary 3-Run-a-Week Training Program (Revised Edition) [Kindle Edition]</i>. The length of the title is silly, so I will just write RLRF.<a href="javascript:history.back()">â†©</a></li>
