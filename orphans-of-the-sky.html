<p>
The first novella of Heinlein I've had the pleasure to read. It tells the story of a space ship, sent to colonize a distant star system, from the perspective of a descendant of the original crew. The ship was constructed as self-supporting, with it's own farm fields and the converter to produce energy and could've been, in principle, inhabited for an unlimited number of years. Created to last several generations on it's journey, the ship is the only home the protagonist knows. In fact, the original purpose of the trip has been completely forgotten: an uprising inverted the balance of power and the knowledge about the history, science and technology started to vanish alarmingly quickly over the years. Subsequent mutations, resultant from prologned exposure to the cosmic radiation, divided the ship into the "normal" and "mutie" territories and started a tribal war.

<p>
Reader is able to observe the post-apocalyptic society which worships the ubiquitous Jordan corporation &mdash; builders of the ship; the society that has forgotten it's heritage and it's purpose. Finally, the society that doesn't even know that anything beside The Ship (written in capital letters) exists, let alone whether it's still traveling or maybe already arrived at it's destination.

<p>
It seems that Heinlein takes the science-fiction setting and not only tries to create a convincing story, but also tells the fable about the human nature. To the question of what can change the nature of a man, the author gives a cold answer: nothing.
